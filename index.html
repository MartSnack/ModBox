			ModBox Beta pre-3.2.2_1
		</h1>
		<p id="introduction">
			BeepBox is an online tool for sketching and sharing chiptune melodies. ModBox expands the world of BeepBox into a whole new realm! We are on the frontier of exploaration with this beta!
		</p>
		<p>
			All song data is packaged into the URL at the top of your browser. When you make changes to the song, the URL is updated
			to reflect your changes. When you are satisfied with your song, just copy and paste the URL to save and share your song!

				<h1>
					Instructions
				</h1>
				<p>
					You can add or remove notes by clicking on the gray rows at the top. BeepBox automatically plays the notes out loud for you.
					Try it!
				</p>
				<p>
					Notes go into patterns, and you can edit one pattern at a time. Those numbered boxes at the bottom of the editor are the
					different patterns you can edit. Click the other boxes to move to a different part of the song, or click the arrows
					on the currently selected box to swap which pattern is played during that part of the song.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are four rows of patterns that BeepBox can play simultaneously, and each row has its own set of patterns. The first
					three rows can play melodies and the bottom row is for drums.
				</p>
				<p>
					The purple loop underneath the numbered boxes controls which part of the song is currently repeating. Move the loop to listen

					to a different part of the song, or drag the ends to expand the loop to include the whole song.
				</p>
				<p>
					When BeepBox has focus (click on its interface above), you can use these keyboard shortcuts: <br/>
				</p>
				<p style="margin-left:50px;">
					Spacebar: Pause or Resume<br/> Z: Undo<br/> Y or Shift Z: Redo<br/> C: Copy the current pattern<br/> V: Paste the current
					pattern<br/>  Q: Go to Custom Song Settings<br/> [ ]: Move the playhead backward and forward<br/> Arrow Keys: Change which bar is selected<br/> 1-8: Reassign
					a pattern to the currently selected bar<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					In the pattern editor, you can click and drag horizontally on a note to adjust its duration. You can also click above or
					below an existing note to enable a rapid arpeggio/trill effect, oscillating between two or more simultaneous notes.
				</p>
				<p>
					AVDANCED: Drag vertically from an existing note to bend its pitch, or drag vertically from above or below the note to adjust
					its volume.
				</p>
				<p>
					ModBox has many more features. Enabling Advanced Settings via the Prefernces Menu unlocks much more of Modbox's features!
